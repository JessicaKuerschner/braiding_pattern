            <p>Our project began with a desire to rethink the human–machine relationship in industrial contexts and to imagine how it could become more convivial, based on voluntary, creative interactions between people and their environment.</p>
            <p>Focusing on rope braiding machines, we draw inspiration from industrial processes yet seek to move beyond them. Just as the maypole dance once inspired the design of braiding machines, we look at how social dances, their gestures, rhythms, and collective organization, might suggest alternative ways of making and working with machines.</p>
            <p>Through engaging with balfolk dance communities, reproducing rope-making techniques, and observing modern braiding lines, we explore how collaboration and creativity can reshape production. What happens when a community, rather than an individual, operates a machine? When production becomes a shared, responsive, and social process?</p>
            <p>Our aim is to create a “machine” that doesn’t follow the logic of industry but offers an alternative, one without a fixed start or end, that values human presence, operates in times of need rather than continuously, and makes collaboration the essential condition of a living, meaningful system.</p>
